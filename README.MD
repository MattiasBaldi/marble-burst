# Marble Burst

A WebGPU compute shaders with particles using Three.js and TSL (Three.js Shading Language).

Particles are sampled from the surface of a marble bust model and animated using compute shaders. Each particle inherits its color from the model's diffuse texture based on UV coordinates.

## Status

Work in progress.

## Tech

- Three.js (WebGPU renderer)
- TSL for compute shaders
- Vite + TypeScript
